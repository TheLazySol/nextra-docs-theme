# Getting Started

Welcome to our documentation! This page demonstrates how to add new content in your Nextra setup.

## Your Setup

Your Nextra configuration uses a custom content directory structure:

- Content files go in `src/app/content/`
- The routing is handled by `src/app/page.tsx`
- MDX files are automatically available as routes

## Adding New Pages

To add a new page:

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `src/app/content/`
2. The filename becomes the route (e.g., `getting-started.mdx` → `/getting-started`)
3. For nested routes, create folders (e.g., `docs/installation.mdx` → `/docs/installation`)

## Next Steps

- Add more MDX files to `src/app/content/`
- Create a `_meta.js` file to configure navigation
- Customize your layout in `src/app/layout.tsx`
